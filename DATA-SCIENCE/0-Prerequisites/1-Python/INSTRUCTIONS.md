# Pre-requisite: Python Basics for Data Science
Please complete all the specified problems.
> **NOTE**: Please provide a separate Python file for each problem unless stated otherwise. Create your submission files in the separate folders provided.
By completing all the problems, you will have a solid understanding of the basics of Python necessary for data science, focusing on syntax, data structures, and fundamental data manipulation.

## PROBLEM #1: Variables and Data Types
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a Python file that:
- Declares variables to store different data types (string, integer, float, boolean, list, dictionary).
- Prints these variables to the console.
- Demonstrates type conversion (e.g., string to integer, float to string) and prints the results.

## PROBLEM #2: Functions and List Comprehensions
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a Python file that:
- Defines a function to calculate the square root of a number (using `math.sqrt`).
- Defines a function to compute the mean of a list of numbers.
- Creates a list of numbers and uses a list comprehension to apply the square root function to each number.
- Prints the list of square roots and the mean of the original list.

## PROBLEM #3: Dictionaries and Data Processing
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a Python file that:
- Defines a dictionary representing a dataset of students (each with `name`, `grade`, and `passed` properties).
- Creates a function to calculate the average grade of all students.
- Creates a function to return a list of names of students who passed (grade >= 60).
- Prints the average grade and the list of passing students.

## PROBLEM #4: List and Dictionary Methods
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a Python file that:
- Defines a list of dictionaries representing products (each with `name`, `price`, and `in_stock` properties).
- Uses a list comprehension to get all in-stock products.
- Uses a loop or comprehension to create a list of product names.
- Uses a function to calculate the total price of in-stock products.
- Prints all results to the console.

## PROBLEM #5: Data Structures for Analysis
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a Python file that:
- Implements a simple sales dataset using a list of dictionaries (each sale has `product`, `quantity`, and `price`).
- Creates functions to:
  - Add a sale to the dataset.
  - Remove a sale by product name.
  - Calculate the total revenue (quantity * price for each sale).
- Demonstrates usage by adding sales, removing one, and printing the total revenue.
