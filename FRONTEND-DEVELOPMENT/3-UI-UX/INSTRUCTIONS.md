## PROBLEM #3: UI/UX Design with Figma
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create the following to design user-friendly interfaces using Figma:
- **Task 1**: A Figma prototype for a task management app with a single screen showing a list of tasks. Include:
  - A header with the app title.
  - A card-based layout for tasks (each with a title and checkbox).
  - A button to add a new task.
  - Use consistent typography and color schemes (e.g., primary color, neutral backgrounds).
- **Task 2**: Extend the Figma prototype from Task 1 to include a second screen for adding a task. Design a form with fields for task title and description, plus a submit button. Export the design as a PDF and include a markdown file (`design-notes.md`) describing the UI/UX principles applied (e.g., clarity, hierarchy, accessibility).
