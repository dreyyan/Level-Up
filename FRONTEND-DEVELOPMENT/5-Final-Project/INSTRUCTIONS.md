# Final Project
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create the following to integrate TypeScript, React, and responsive design with UI/UX principles:
- **Task 1**: A React app (`index.html`, `App.tsx`) based on the Figma prototype from Problem #3, Task 1. Implement the task list screen with:
  - A header (`<h1>`).
  - Task cards (title, checkbox for completion status).
  - A button to toggle between light and dark themes (use Tailwind CSS).
  - Use TypeScript interfaces for task data.
- **Task 2**: Extend the app from Task 1 to include the task creation form from Problem #3, Task 2. Add:
  - A form with inputs for task title and description (both required).
  - A submit button to add tasks to the list (store in state).
  - A separate TypeScript file (`taskUtils.ts`) for validation logic (check non-empty fields).
  - Log new task data to the console on submission.
  - Ensure the layout is responsive (single-column on mobile, multi-column on desktop) using Tailwind CSS.
