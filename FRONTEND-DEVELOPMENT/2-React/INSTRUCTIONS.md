## PROBLEM #2: React Components
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create the following to build reusable React components:
- **Task 1**: A React app (`index.html`, `App.tsx`) with a single component (`UserCard`) that displays a userâ€™s `name` and `email` (passed as props). Use TypeScript to define prop types. Render 3 `UserCard` components with different data.
- **Task 2**: Extend the app from Task 1 to include a `UserList` component that maps over an array of users (stored in state) and renders `UserCard` components. Add a button to add a new user (with hardcoded data) to the state. Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
