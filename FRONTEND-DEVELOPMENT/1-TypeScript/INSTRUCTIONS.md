## PROBLEM #1: TypeScript Basics
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create the following to learn TypeScript fundamentals:
- **Task 1**: A TypeScript file (`greetings.ts`) with a function `greetUser` that takes a `name` (string) and `age` (number) as parameters and returns a greeting string. Use explicit types and log the result to the console.
- **Task 2**: An HTML page (`index.html`) with a button that, when clicked, calls a TypeScript function (in a separate `app.ts` file) to display a list of 3 users (each with `name` and `age` properties) in a `<ul>` element. Use interfaces to define the user type.
