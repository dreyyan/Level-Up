## PROBLEM #4: Responsive Design
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create the following to implement responsive layouts:
- **Task 1**: A React app (`index.html`, `App.tsx`) with a responsive navigation bar using Tailwind CSS. Include links to "Home", "Tasks", and "Profile". Ensure the navbar is a horizontal menu on desktop and collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile (use a simple toggle button).
- **Task 2**: Extend the app from Task 1 to include a responsive task list grid. Display tasks as cards (title and description) in a 3-column grid on desktop, 2-column on tablet, and 1-column on mobile. Use TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.
