## PROBLEM #4: Databases
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create the following to integrate MongoDB with Express.js using Mongoose:
- **Task 1**: An Express.js app with Mongoose connected to MongoDB. Define a Book schema with `title` (string, required), `author` (string, required), `published` (number). Implement POST /books to save a book and return it.
- **Task 2**: Extend the app from Task 1 with endpoints:
  - GET /books (list all books)
  - GET /books/:id (get a book by ID)
  - PUT /books/:id (update a bookâ€™s title or author)
  - DELETE /books/:id (delete a book)
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
