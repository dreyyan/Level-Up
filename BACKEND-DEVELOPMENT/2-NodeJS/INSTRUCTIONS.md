## PROBLEM #2: Node.js
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create the following to learn Node.js fundamentals:
- **Task 1**: A Node.js script that reads a JSON file (`books.json`) containing an array of books (each with `id`, `title`, `author`). Log the books to the console and handle file-not-found errors.
- **Task 2**: A Node.js script creating an HTTP server (using `http` module) on port 3000. Implement:
  - GET / (returns "Welcome to the Book Library")
  - GET /books (returns a JSON array of 3 hardcoded books)
  - Other routes (return 404 with "Not Found")
