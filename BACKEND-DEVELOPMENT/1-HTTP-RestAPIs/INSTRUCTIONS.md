## PROBLEM #1: HTTP and REST APIs
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create the following to understand HTTP methods and REST API design:
- **Task 1**: A markdown file documenting a REST API for a "Book Library" application with endpoints:
  - GET /books (list all books)
  - GET /books/:id (get a specific book)
  - POST /books (create a book)
  - PUT /books/:id (update a book)
  - DELETE /books/:id (delete a book)
  - For each endpoint, include the HTTP method, URL, request body (if applicable), and expected response format.
- **Task 2**: An HTML page with a button that, when clicked, logs a mock JSON response for the GET /books endpoint (include 3 books with `id`, `title`, and `author`) to the console using a separate JavaScript file.
