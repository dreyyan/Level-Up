# Pre-requisite: JavaScript Basics for React
Please complete all the specified problems.
> **NOTE**: Please provide a separate JavaScript file for each problem unless stated otherwise. Create your submission files in the separate folders provided.
By completing all the problems, you will have a solid understanding of the basics of JavaScript necessary for React development, focusing on syntax and data structures.

## PROBLEM #1: Variables and Data Types
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a JavaScript file that:
- Declares variables using `let`, `const`, and `var` to store different data types (string, number, boolean, array, object).
- Logs these variables to the console.
- Demonstrates the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` by attempting to reassign values and logging the results.

## PROBLEM #2: Functions and Arrow Functions
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a JavaScript file that:
- Defines a traditional function to calculate the square of a number.
- Defines an arrow function to calculate the cube of a number.
- Creates an array of numbers and uses `map` to apply both functions to the array.
- Logs the results to the console.

## PROBLEM #3: Objects and Methods
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a JavaScript file that:
- Defines an object representing a car with properties (`make`, `model`, `year`) and a method to return a description string.
- Creates an array of car objects.
- Uses a loop to call the description method for each car and logs the results.

## PROBLEM #4: Array Methods
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a JavaScript file that:
- Defines an array of objects representing products (each with `name`, `price`, and `inStock` properties).
- Uses `filter` to get all in-stock products.
- Uses `map` to create an array of product names.
- Uses `reduce` to calculate the total price of in-stock products.
- Logs all results to the console.

## PROBLEM #5: Data Structures
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a JavaScript file that:
- Implements a simple shopping cart using an array to store items (each item is an object with `name` and `quantity`).
- Creates functions to add an item, remove an item by name, and calculate the total quantity of items.
- Demonstrates usage by adding items, removing one, and logging the total quantity.
