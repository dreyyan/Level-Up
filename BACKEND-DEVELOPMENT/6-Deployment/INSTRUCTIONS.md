## PROBLEM #6: Deployment
### INSTRUCTIONS:
Create the following to deploy a MERN backend:
- **Task 1**: A `Procfile` for deploying the Express.js app from Problem #5, Task 2 to Render. Add a `start` script in `package.json` using the `PORT` environment variable. Provide a markdown file with instructions for deploying to Render, including MongoDB Atlas setup and environment variables.
- **Task 2**: An `.env.example` file for the app from Problem #5, Task 2, listing required environment variables (`MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`). Update the app to use these with the `dotenv` package.
